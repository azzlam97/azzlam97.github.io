This page contains projects which I have worked on as part of my work, university degree, or in my free time.

# Thesis

As part of my Masters Degree, I completed a Thesis project alongside an industry partner. My project was focused on creating a possession value model in order to evaluate stoppage strategies in Australian Football. Through this project, I created a dashboard which allows users to create hypothetical scenarios and view how different chains influence the chances of scoring. Below are a few images which showcase the functions of the dashboard, as well as a few screenshots from my presentation showing the results of the model.
