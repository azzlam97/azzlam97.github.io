My project was focused on creating a possession value model in order to evaluate stoppage strategies in Australian Football. Through this project, I created a dashboard which allows users to create hypothetical scenarios and view how different chains influence the chances of scoring. Below are a few images which showcase the functions of the dashboard, as well as a few screenshots from my presentation showing the results of the model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrief video showing the dashboard in action.\n\nScreenshots from my thesis presentation.\n\n\n\nOther Work\nThese are an assortment of work ranging from university assignments to things I’ve done at work.\n\n08/09 Lakers Analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn-Season (2023) Top 8 Simulation (AFL)"
